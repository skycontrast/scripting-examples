2019-2020 Remote Sensing

Compilation of basic scrips authored during my Advanced Diplome in Remote Sensing at the Centre of Geographic Sciences 

Topics:

image pre-processing  and post-processing automation,  raster manipulation and file handling for raster analysis and representation

Example:

- atmospheric corrections
- cloud/water/haze masking
- raster shape clipping
- enhancements 
- layer stacking 
- band arimethic
- spectral indices
- scene mosaicing 
- image segmentation
- supervised and unsupervised  classifications
